    ```

4.  ### Environment Variables

    This project uses environment variables for sensitive settings.

    Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following contents:
    SECRET_KEY=your_random_secret_key_here

    - `SECRET_KEY` ‚Üí Used by Flask for securely signing the session cookies.  
    **Generate a random one** with:
    ```bash
    python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(16))"
    ```
    Add the key to .env file as a value of *SECRET_KEY*

4.  **Run the application:**
    Start the Flask development server.

    ```bash
    flask run
    ```
    The application will now be running at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
